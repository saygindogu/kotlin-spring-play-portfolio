## Some things I had to say

Intention for this project is to get familiar with the Spring Framework and the Kotlin Programming Language.

Initial Spring Project is started by following the tutorial: [Kotlin Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/)

Which was started with the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with the following dependencies:
- Spring Web
- Mustache
- Spring Data JPA
- H2
- Spring Boot Devtools

Crazy stuff happened today.

This repo is going too experimental for being a proper project.

- Introduction of the KotlinJS React app.
- Spring <-> React Connection
- Basic React Form
- Rest API for articles => To be replaced
- Dockerization

# 2020-12-20
Today's goal is to successfully adding an article.

- Nailed it. -> requires user object creation and the dropdown or some sort of list UI to chose user from to be proper.

Still, nice.

# 2020-12-16
Today's goal is to go fancy and somehow tie a kotlinJS react application to the Mustache Engine of the Spring Framework.
Actually I'll try to deep dive in the Spring Framework.

- Ended up not doing so much with the code.

# 2020-12-15
Today's goal is to initialize the project and commit the initial commit.

- Initialized the "Hello World" project.
