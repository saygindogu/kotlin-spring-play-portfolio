# Saygin Dogu Portfolio Kotlin Spring Play Project

Intention for this project is to get familiar with the Spring Framework and the Kotlin Programming Language.

Initial Spring Project is started by following the tutorial: [Kotlin Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/)

Which was started with the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with the following dependencies:
- Spring Web
- Mustache
- Spring Data JPA
- H2
- Spring Boot Devtools

Today's goal is to successfully adding an article.

- Nailed it. -> requires user object creation and the dropdown or some sort of list UI to chose user from to be proper.

Still nice.

Today's goal is to go fancy and somehow tie a kotlinJS react application to the Mustache Engine of the Spring Framework.
Actually I'll try to deep dive in the Spring Framework.

- Ended up not doing so much with the code.

Today's goal is to initialize the project and commit the initial commit.

- Initialized the "Hello World" project.
